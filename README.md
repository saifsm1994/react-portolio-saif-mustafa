# React Portfolio Page for Saif Mustafa

A simple ReactJS portfolio page bootstrapped through [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you want to try this out yourself you can run it with the typical create-react-app commands such as Yarn Start and Yarn Build, but you will need to subsitute images for a few pathways whose images are not part of this repo.

Other used technologies include


* React-bootstrap and bootstrap for layout and reusable elements
* AOS - for animations on scrolling
* Font Awesome for icons
